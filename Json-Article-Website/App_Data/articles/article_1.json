We have several amazing challenges running right now, each with meaningful prizes, and I genuinely think this could be a great moment for many of you to get involved.\n\nThere are four challenges active, with a fifth one launching later this week. Together, they represent over $10,000 in prizes! Whether you\u0027re drawn to backend development, frontend design, voice technology, or storytelling, you can find your niche.\n\nHaving diverse options means smaller, focused groups of participants in each area rather than one overwhelming competition. This creates better opportunities to showcase what you do best (and win!).\n\nReady to join?\nBrowse the challenges above and see what sparks your curiosity! There\u0027s no pressure to enter multiple ones \u2013 sometimes focusing on what genuinely excites you leads to the most rewarding experience.\n\nThese challenges are designed as learning opportunities as much as competitions. Every submission contributes to the community\u0027s creativity and shared knowledge.\n\nWant to help in another way?\nWe\u0027re always looking for volunteer judges to help evaluate challenge submissions. If you\u0027d prefer to contribute by reviewing","CreatedDate":"2025-07-26T00:00:00"}
